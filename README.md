# Home-Assistant-DreamScreen-Service
This is a custom component for Home-Assistant which will add the ability to control a Wifi enabled DreamScreen (HD & 4k).  Currently the support is new/experimental.

# Installation/Usage

## Hacs custom repo

If you use [Hacs](https://hacs.xyz) go to Settings and paste 
`https://github.com/GregoryDosh/Home-Assistant-DreamScreen-Service` and choose `integration`.
You now can switch to the Integrations Tab and install DreamScreen-Service. 

Continue with [configuration](#configuration)

## Manual install

**DEPRECATED - not recommended. - use HACS instead** 
Copy the contents of `custom_components/dreamscreen/` to the same dir of your homeassistant 


## Configuration

Simply adding the `dreamscreen` component will enable device autodiscovery.
**THIS DOES NOT WORK See #18. Add your hostname/ip** 

```yaml
dreamscreen:
```

Depending on your network some times a search may terminate before the discovery
has completed. You can specify the timeout to use before the component will give
up waiting for a response.

```yaml
dreamscreen:
  timeout: 5
```
If you want you can configure the devices by hostname or IP address, this will disable
auto discovery.

```yaml
dreamscreen:
  devices:
    - dream_screen:
        address: 192.168.0.140
```

Finally: you can specify the timeout for the component to wait for a response when
requesting the current state from the device.

```yaml
dreamscreen:
  devices:
    - dream_screen:
        address: 192.168.0.140
        timeout: 5
```

## Example Configuration
This exposes the input sources as individual bulbs for the emulated_hue bridge so that you might control the HDMI inputs via Harmony or some other apps.

```yaml
dreamscreen:

homeassistant:
  customize:
    script.dreamscreen_input_source_1:
      emulated_hue_hidden: false
      hidden: true
    script.dreamscreen_input_source_2:
      emulated_hue_hidden: false
      hidden: true
    script.dreamscreen_input_source_3:
      emulated_hue_hidden: false
      hidden: true

script:
  dreamscreen_input_source_1:
    alias: "DreamScreen - Source 1"
    sequence:
      - service: dreamscreen.set_hdmi_source
        data:
          entity_id: dreamscreen.living_room
          source: 0
  dreamscreen_input_source_2:
    alias: "DreamScreen - Source 2"
    sequence:
      - service: dreamscreen.set_hdmi_source
        data:
          entity_id: dreamscreen.living_room
          source: 1
  dreamscreen_input_source_3:
    alias: "DreamScreen - Source 3"
    sequence:
      - service: dreamscreen.set_hdmi_source
        data:
          entity_id: dreamscreen.living_room
          source: 2
